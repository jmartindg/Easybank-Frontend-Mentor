## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS Utility-First Framework

### What I learned

I learned how to setup and work with TailwindCSS to build this website.

### Continued development

Since I did not copied different styles in the challenge, I will try to learn and improve my CSS skills so that I will replicate the styles even if it's not 100% pixel perfect. However I changed some styles for my own preferences.

### Useful resources

- [Setup TailwindCSS Easily](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTjxyIq0nqU) - Thanks to James Q. Quick for his tutorial on how to setup TailwindCSS.
